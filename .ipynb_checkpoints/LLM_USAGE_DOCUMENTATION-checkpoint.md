## üìù Detailed Usage Log

### Initial Project Setup
**Human Prompt:**
```
Can you access this data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

Part 1: Retrospective Analysis
Setup the data in your favourite interactive BI/visualisation tool. Set up anything that showcases your skills or interests. Ideally, use a tool that uses some query language and has charts, visualisations, dashboards, filters, cross-tabs, etc. We've had applicants use free versions of PowerBI, Metabase, Looker Studio, Superset, etc. We've had candidates who showed their python notebooks on used modern tools like Hex. 

Create 2 visualizations using code. The most impressive applicants typically find interesting insights and use sophisticated charts (like waterfall, sankey, mekko, etc.), but only when relevant, not for vanity.
Delivery performance: Analysis of orders delivered late vs. on time, segmented by relevant features such as product category.
Customer retention: Cluster customers by RFM and calculate their lifetime value
Write a brief analysis explaining 2 or 3 most interesting or concerning trends you discovered from your retrospective analysis after adjusting for potential biases in the data (eg geographic skew). 
Make a strategic recommendation for the Head of Seller Relations 

Part 2: Predictive Analysis
Prepare a feature set from the dataset, including relevant variables & handle any preprocessing.
Train a basic supervised model to predict a binary outcome: whether a review score will be high (4-5) or low (1-3), based on order features. Use a train-test split (eg 80/20).
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. Include a simple feature importance analysis.
Share your view on the model's limitations (e.g., class imbalance in reviews), potential improvements (e.g., adding more features), how this could inform business decisions (e.g., predicting satisfaction to reduce churn), and how this model would scale.
```
