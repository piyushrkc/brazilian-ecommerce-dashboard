gh repo create brazilian-ecommerce-dashboard --public
```

---

## Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

## Step 4: Create Render Account and Deploy

### 4.1: Sign up for Render
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click "Get Started" 
3. Choose "Sign up with GitHub" (recommended)
4. Authorize Render to access your GitHub repositories

### 4.2: Create Web Service

2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. Choose **"Build and deploy from a Git repository"**
4. Click **"Connect GitHub"** if not already connected
5. Find and select your `brazilian-ecommerce-dashboard` repository
6. Click **"Connect"**

### 4.3: Configure Service Settings
Fill in these exact settings:

**Basic Settings:**
- **Name**: `brazilian-ecommerce-dashboard`
- **Region**: Choose closest to your location (e.g., "US East" or "Europe West")
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Root Directory**: Leave empty
- **Runtime**: `Python 3`

**Build & Deploy:**
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:server`

---

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

### What Happens Next:
1. **Build Process** (5-10 minutes):
   - Render will clone your repository
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Build your application

2. **Deployment Status**:
   - You'll see real-time logs in the Render dashboard
   - Green "Live" badge means success
   - Red "Failed" badge means there's an issue

3. **Your Dashboard URL**:
   - Will be: `https://brazilian-ecommerce-dashboard.onrender.com`
   - Or similar (Render may add random characters if name is taken)

### If Build Succeeds ‚úÖ:
- Click on your service URL
- Your dashboard should load within 30 seconds
- Share the URL with stakeholders!

### If Build Fails ‚ùå:
Check the deployment logs for errors. Common issues:
- **Port binding error**: Fixed in our code
- **Memory limits**: Dashboard is optimized for free tier
- **Dependency issues**: Our requirements.txt should handle this

## Step 6: Test Your Live Dashboard

Once deployed, test these features:
1. **üìä Executive Summary**: Key metrics display correctly
2. **üì¶ Delivery Performance**: Waterfall chart loads
3. **üë• RFM Segmentation**: Treemap shows "R$ XX avg" (not NaN)
4. **üåç Geographic Distribution**: Interactive Brazil map works
5. **ü§ñ Predictive Model**: User input form predicts correctly
6. **üìö Documentation**: Python code displays in both notebooks

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Application failed to start"
**Solution**: Check logs in Render dashboard, usually a dependency issue

### Issue: Dashboard loads slowly
**Solution**: Normal for free tier - first load takes 30+ seconds after inactivity

### Issue: "Repository not found"
**Solution**: Ensure repository is PUBLIC, not private

### Issue: Build fails during pip install
**Solution**: Check requirements.txt format and dependencies

### Issue: Dashboard displays but features don't work
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
