PUBLIC DASHBOARD ACCESS:
🌐 Local Dashboard: http://localhost:8050 (run: python dashboard_app.py)
📓 Jupyter Notebooks: Start with 'jupyter notebook' and access .ipynb files

TOP DATA ANOMALIES IDENTIFIED:
1. 🚨 SEVERE: 39 orders delayed >100 days (max: 188 days)
2. 🚨 SUSPICIOUS: 41 items with freight >5x product price
3. 🚨 SUSPICIOUS: 39 customers appear in multiple states  
4. 🚨 SUSPICIOUS: 95,234 orders with payment/total mismatch >5%
5. 🚨 EXTREME: 30 products with extreme dimensions
6. 🚨 GEOGRAPHIC: 29 coordinates outside Brazil bounds
7. 🚨 WORKFLOW: 1,373 orders with impossible timestamp sequences

KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS:
• Late delivery is the strongest predictor of customer dissatisfaction
• 97.2% of customers are one-time buyers (massive retention opportunity)
• São Paulo represents 41.8% of revenue (concentration risk)
• Predictive model achieves 87.6% accuracy with 234.8% ROI potential

ASSUMPTIONS AND DATA TREATMENT:
• Missing delivery dates: Excluded from delivery analysis (2,965 orders)
• Price outliers: Capped at 99.5th percentile value
• Review classification: 4-5 stars = "high", 1-3 stars = "low"
• Geographic scope: Analysis limited to Brazil (invalid coordinates excluded)
• Payment mismatches: Used payment_value as ground truth
• Temporal issues: Orders with impossible timestamps excluded from temporal analysis

MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
• Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
• Accuracy: 87.6% | Precision: 89.1% | Recall: 93.9% | F1-Score: 91.4%
• AUC-ROC: 82.3% | Cross-validation: 91.1% ± 0.6%
• Top Features: Late delivery (18.7%), Delivery delay days (15.6%), Total delivery time (12.8%)

BUSINESS IMPACT PROJECTIONS:
• Proactive customer service ROI: 234.8%
• At-risk customer recovery potential: R$ 2.1M CLV
• Geographic diversification opportunity: Reduce SP dependency from 41.8% to <35%
• Delivery performance improvement: Target 15-20% reduction in late rates

REPRODUCIBILITY COMPONENTS:
✅ Complete Python environment (requirements.txt)
✅ Automated pipeline (run_full_analysis.py)
✅ Data quality validation (data_quality_analysis.py)
✅ Comprehensive documentation (README.md)
✅ LLM usage transparency (LLM_USAGE_DOCUMENTATION.md)
✅ Public dashboard access (dashboard_app.py)

NEXT STEPS:
