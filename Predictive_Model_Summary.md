# Part 2: Predictive Analysis Summary
## Customer Satisfaction Prediction Model

### Executive Summary
Built a supervised machine learning model to predict customer review satisfaction (high 4-5 stars vs low 1-3 stars) based on order features. The model enables proactive identification of orders likely to receive poor reviews, allowing for preventive customer service interventions.

## Model Development Process

### **1. Feature Engineering & Data Preparation**
- **Dataset**: 96,476 delivered orders with complete review data
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (High: 4-5 stars = 77.4%, Low: 1-3 stars = 22.6%)
- **Feature Categories**:
  - **Delivery Performance**: Delivery days, delay days, late delivery flag
  - **Order Characteristics**: Items count, price, freight, installments
  - **Temporal Features**: Order hour, day of week, month
  - **Customer Geography**: State-level information
  - **Payment Details**: Payment type, installment patterns

**Key Engineered Features**:
```python
- delivery_delay_days: (actual_delivery - estimated_delivery)
- freight_to_price_ratio: freight_cost / order_value
- product_diversity_ratio: unique_products / total_items
- is_delivered_late: Binary flag for late deliveries
- avg_item_value: total_price / total_items
```

### **2. Model Training & Selection**
**Models Tested**:
- Random Forest Classifier (with class balancing)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Logistic Regression (with standardized features)

**Train-Test Split**: 80/20 with stratified sampling to maintain class distribution

## Model Limitations & Improvements

### **Current Limitations**

1. **Class Imbalance**: 77.4% vs 22.6% distribution
   - *Impact*: Model slightly biased toward predicting high reviews
   - *Mitigation*: Used class balancing, consider SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning

2. **Temporal Bias**: Training data from 2016-2018
   - *Impact*: May not capture current market conditions
   - *Mitigation*: Implement automated retraining pipeline

3. **Feature Gaps**: Missing key predictive variables
   - Seller historical performance
   - Product category satisfaction trends
   - Customer purchase history
   - Competitive pricing context

4. **Geographic Concentration**: 71.3% of data from top 3 states
   - *Impact*: Model may not generalize to smaller markets
   - *Mitigation*: Stratified sampling by region in training

### **Proposed Improvements**

**Short-term (1-3 months)**:
- Add seller performance metrics
- Include product category satisfaction history
- Implement model monitoring dashboard
- Establish feedback loop for intervention outcomes

**Medium-term (3-6 months)**:
