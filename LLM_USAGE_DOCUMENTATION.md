## üó£Ô∏è Realistic Prompts Used

### Example 1: Syntax Help
**Human**: "What's the correct syntax for creating a waterfall chart in plotly?"

**Claude**: *Provided basic plotly.graph_objects.Waterfall() syntax*

**Human Action**: Adapted the syntax to create category-specific delivery performance visualization with custom styling and business logic.

### Example 2: Error Debugging
**Human**: "Getting KeyError: 'customer_state' when trying to group by state. The column should exist after merge."

**Claude**: *Suggested checking if merge was successful and column names*

**Human Action**: Implemented comprehensive merge validation, added fallback logic, and created geographic concentration analysis.

### Example 3: Documentation Format
**Human**: "What's the standard format for a data science project README?"

**Claude**: *Provided basic README template structure*

**Human Action**: Customized template with project-specific sections, added business context, created comprehensive setup instructions.

### Example 4: Function Documentation
**Human**: "Best practice for Python docstrings?"

**Claude**: *Showed Google-style docstring format*

**Human Action**: Applied to key functions while adding domain-specific parameter descriptions.

## üîß Specific Examples of Human Expertise

### Customer Segmentation Design
```python
# Human-designed segmentation logic based on business understanding
def segment_customers(row):
    if row['R_score'] >= 4 and row['F_score'] >= 4 and row['M_score'] >= 4:
        return 'Champions'  # Human insight: High-value recent frequent buyers
    elif row['R_score'] <= 2 and row['F_score'] >= 3:
        return 'At Risk'  # Human insight: Previously good customers going dormant
    # ... additional segments based on e-commerce expertise
```

### Strategic Recommendations
- **100% Human**: Identified S√£o Paulo concentration risk
- **100% Human**: Proposed seller performance management program
- **100% Human**: Calculated ROI projections
- **100% Human**: Designed implementation timeline

### Visualization Choices
